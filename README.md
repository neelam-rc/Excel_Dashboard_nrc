# Bike Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Bike Sales Analysis  

A bike sales dashboard in Excel can provide a centralized view of data, which can help identify patterns, understand sales trends and make business decisions. The dataset is from Kaggle. 

## Project Structure

1. Data cleaning: Remove duplicate entries, eliminate excess blanks and manual errors to ensure the accuracy of the data. 
2. Data organization: Categorize age groups and convert abbreviations into full forms to improve readability. 
3. Use pivot tables and charts: These can help visualize data and understand sales trends. 
4. Add slicers: Slicers can help users filter data based on factors like marital status, occupation, education, and region. 
5. Add a reset button: A reset button can help revert all slicers to their original state.
